Description de 8 nouvelles familles avec mutations du gène LMNA.\nINTRODUCTION: Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1b (LGMD1B), due to LMNA gene mutations, is a relatively rare form of LGMD characterized by proximal muscle involvement associated with heart involvement comprising atrio-ventricular conduction blocks and dilated cardiomyopathy. Its clinical and genetic diagnosis is crucial for cardiac management and genetic counselling. Seven LMNA mutations have been previously reported to be responsible for LGMD1B.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the neurological and cardiologic features of 14 patients belonging to 8 families in whom we identified 6 different LMNA mutations, 4 of them having never been reported. Results. Eleven patients had an LGMD1B phenotype with scapulohumeral and pelvic-femoral involvement. Thirteen patients had cardiac disease associating conduction defects (12 patients) or arrhythmias (9 patients). Seven patients needed cardiac device (pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator) and two had heart transplantation.\nCONCLUSION: This study allowed us to specify the clinical characteristics of this entity and to outline the first phenotype/genotype relations resulting from these observations.", "entities": {"Disease": ["Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1b"], "Reg": ["due to"], "Gene": ["LMNA"], "Var": ["mutations"]}}

Primarily, mutations in LMNA have been associated to the autosomal forms of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, a rare slowly progressive humero-peroneal muscular dystrophy accompanied by early contractures and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. LMNA mutations have been reported to be responsible for up to 10 distinct phenotypes that affect specifically either the skeletal and/or cardiac muscle, the adipose tissue, the peripheral nervous tissue, the bone tissue or more recently premature ageing. So far more than 180 different LMNA mutations have been identified in 903 individuals. The first studies of phenotype/genotype relationships revealed no dear relation between the phenotype and the type and/or the localization of the mutation, except perhaps for the globular tail domain of lamins A/C. Studies of the consequences of LMNA mutations in the skin cultured fibroblasts from the patients reveal abnormal nuclei in variable proportions, with dysmorphic nuclei exhibiting abnormal patterns of expression of B-type lamins and emerin. Finally, the development of KO and KI LMNA mice, will certainly give further insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with LMNA mutations.

It has been shown that the disease is caused by cathepsin C gene (CTSC) mutation leading to the deficiency of cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This study demonstrates the clinical manifestations and CTSC mutational and enzymatic activity analyses in a 5-year-old Thai male PLS patient and his parents.\nMETHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained for genomic DNA isolation. All exons of the CTSC gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. Verification of the mutation was performed by digestion of PCR products by restriction endonucleases. The cathepsin C enzymatic activity was determined using the synthetic substrate glycyl- L-arginine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin.\nRESULTS: The patient demonstrated classical characteristics of PLS, including hyperkeratotic skin lesions. By the age of 5, all of his primary teeth were extracted due to severe periodontal infection. The parents had no physical abnormalities. The periodontal examination revealed localized mild periodontal destruction. Sequence analysis showed a nucleotide change at position 90 from C >A (c.90C >A) which resulted in a change from cysteine residue to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 30 in the exon 1. The HpyCH4V digestion revealed that the patient was homozygous, whereas both the father and mother were heterozygous carriers of this mutation. The cathepsin C activity was reduced in the patient's mother, and the activity in the patient was almost completely lost.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate a CTSC gene mutation in a Thai family with PLS. The identified mutation is novel and potentially leads to the drastic reduction of the cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This suggests that the mutation is pathogenetic, causing the PLS. Mutational analysis in more members of the family is warranted to identify whether the mutation is inherited from a common ancestor.", "entities": {"Var": ["mutation", "c.90C >A"], "Gene": ["cathepsin C", "CTSC"], "Reg": ["with", "resulted in", "causing"], "Disease": ["Papillon-Lefevre syndrome", "PLS"], "NegReg": ["deficiency", "reduction"], "Enzyme": ["cathepsin C enzymatic"], "MPA": ["activity", "premature stop codon"]}}

Children affected with this disease tend to develop normally for the first 5 years of life. However, once disease onset occurs, they decline rapidly and die in their late 20s to early 30s. Though this represents the typical disease course, the onset and severity of disease symptoms can vary. This variability is presumed to be the result of both differences in the causative genetic mutation in the CLN3 gene as well as environmental influences. Most cases of JNCL are caused by a 1 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation predicted to leave the first 153 amino acids of the CLN3 protein intact, followed by the addition of 28 novel amino acids. Here we report the discovery of a novel mutation identified as a G to T transversion at nucleotide 49 (G49T) in exon 2 of CLN3, introducing a premature stop codon (E17X) near the N-terminus.

In addition to SLAM, SAP associates with several other cell-surface receptors including 2B4 (CD244), Ly9 (CD229), CD84 and NTB-A. SAP contains a single src-homology-2 domain and acts as an intracellular adaptor protein by recruiting the protein tyrosine kinase FynT to the cytoplasmic domains of some of these receptors, which results in the initiation of specific downstream signal transduction pathways. XLP is likely to result from perturbed signalling through one or more of these SAP-associating receptors. In this study, we identified missense (Y54C, I84T and F87S) and insertion (fs82 --> X103) mutations in four different kindreds affected by XLP. Each mutation dramatically reduced the half-life of SAP, thus diminishing its expression in primary lymphocytes as well as in transfected cell lines.

However, signalling downstream of SLAM was reduced in the presence of SAP bearing the I84T mutation.

Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (RP18), PRPF8 (RP13), PRPF31 (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9. Families without mutations in autosomal genes and in which an X-linked mode of inheritance could not be excluded were tested for mutations in ORF 15 of X-linked RPGR. Potentially pathogenic variants were evaluated based on a variety of genetic and computational criteria, to confirm or exclude pathogenicity.\nRESULTS: A total of 82 distinct, rare (nonpolymorphic) variants were detected among the genes tested. Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations. Two families (1%) have a pathogenic RPGR mutation, indicating that families with apparent autosomal transmission of RP may actually have X-linked genetic disease. Thus, 107 families (53.5%) have mutations in known genes, leaving 93 whose underlying cause is still unknown.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, the known adRP genes account for retinal disease in approximately half of the families in this survey, mostly Americans of European origin. Among the adRP genes, IMPDH1, PRPF8, PRPF31, RDS, RHO, and RP1 each accounts for more than 2% of the total; CRX, PRPF3, and RPGR each accounts for roughly 1%.

Mutations in the AR gene cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is divided into subgroups according to the degree of undermasculinization. Patients with completely female external genitalia are classified as complete AIS (CAIS). However, a recent study has shown that some CAIS patients have signs of internal male genital differentiation due to missense mutations that show some degree of residual function.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the expression of the different forms of the AR in two CAIS patients in relation to the development of male internal genital structures. One patient had a mutation (L7fsX33) that affects only the full-length AR-B form of the AR, whereas the other had a nonsense mutation (Q733X) affecting both isoforms.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We thoroughly analysed internal genitalia at surgery and by histological examination.

Mutations are mainly truncating mutations or deletions, missense mutations having been reported in few cases. An important phenotypic variability is observed among gene carriers. To assess whether the phenotypic variability of neurofibromatosis 2 could be linked to genotype, clinical data of 154 patients whose NF2 germline alteration had been identified in our laboratory have been collected.\nMETHODS: A retrospective questionnaire was sent to the physicians in charge of these patients. Statistical analyses regarding genotypic and phenotypic data were performed by comparisons of average values and correlation tests.\nRESULTS: In French patients, type of mutation was correlated neither with patients' sex, nor with disease occurrence mode (de novo or inherited mutation). Disease associated with missense mutations occurred later, with a less severe symptomatology. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were more frequently affected with meningiomas and spinal tumours, in addition to VIII nerve schwannomas, an observation that underlies the genetic determination of the number and type of NF2-related tumours.\nCONCLUSION: Results from the literature as well as from our study tend to show that only few correlations exist between genotype and phenotype in the NF2 disease. It also recognizes that missense mutations have a lower level of evolution, severity and mortality risk. Nonsense and frameshift mutations seem to be associated with a higher number of meningiomas and spinal tumours. Therefore, NF2 gene screening keeps its indications in both typical and moderate forms of the disease. Mutations are responsible of 80 p.cent of typical forms; in moderate forms, identification of a missense mutation seems linked to a lower disease evolution.

As shown by means of functional studies, these two NALP12 mutations have a deleterious effect on NF-kappaB signaling. Overall, these data identify a group of HPFs defined by molecular defects in NALP12, opening up new ways to manage these disorders.

Mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been initially associated with autosomal recessive Stargardt disease. Subsequent studies have shown that mutations in ABCA4 can also cause a variety of other retinal dystrophies including cone rod dystrophy and retinitis pigmentosa. To determine the prevalence and mutation spectrum of ABCA4 gene mutations in non-Stargardt phenotypes, we have screened 64 unrelated patients with autosomal recessive cone (arCD) and cone rod dystrophy (arCRD) applying the Asper Ophthalmics ABCR400 microarray followed by DNA sequencing of all coding exons of the ABCA4 gene in subjects with single heterozygous mutations. Disease-associated ABCA4 alleles were identified in 20 of 64 patients with arCD or arCRD. In four of 64 patients (6%) only one mutant ABCA4 allele was detected and in 16 patients (25%), mutations on both ABCA4 alleles were identified. Based on these data we estimate a prevalence of 31% for ABCA4 mutations in arCD and arCRD, supporting the concept that the ABCA4 gene is a major locus for various types of degenerative retinal diseases with abnormalities in cone or both cone and rod function.", "entities": {"Var": ["Mutations", "mutations"], "Gene": ["ABCA4"], "Reg": ["associated with", "cause"], "Disease": ["Stargardt disease", "retinal dystrophies", "cone rod dystrophy", "retinitis pigmentosa"]}}

Most of these mutations are characterized by DNA changes that lead to premature termination codons. We investigated 6 different PRPF31 mutations, represented by single-base substitutions or microdeletions, in cell lines derived from 9 patients with dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Five of these mutations lead to premature termination codons, and 1 leads to the skipping of exon 2. Allele-specific measurement of PRPF31 transcripts revealed a strong reduction in the expression of mutant alleles. As a consequence, total PRPF31 protein abundance was decreased, and no truncated proteins were detected. Subnuclear localization of the full-length PRPF31 that was present remained unaffected. Blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay significantly restored the amount of mutant PRPF31 mRNA but did not restore the synthesis of mutant proteins, even in conjunction with inhibitors of protein degradation pathways. Our results indicate that most PRPF31 mutations ultimately result in null alleles through the activation of surveillance mechanisms that inactivate mutant mRNA and, possibly, proteins.

Mutations in alphaB-crystallin, desmin, myotilin, Zasp, or filamin-C can cause MFMs and were detected in 32 of 85 patients of the Mayo MFM cohort. Bag3, another Z-disk-associated protein, has antiapoptotic properties, and its targeted deletion in mice causes fulminant myopathy with early lethality.

Selected confocal images of corneal layers were evaluated qualitatively for shape and degree of light reflection of deposits.\nRESULTS: Novel mutations in the UBIAD1 gene (Y174C, K181R, and N233H) were identified. Additionally, cosegregation of the mutation (Y174C) and SCCD was confirmed in 1 pedigree, indicating that the mutation of the UBIAD1 gene is causative for SCCD. The 3 mutations were absent in all 200 control chromosomes. In vivo laser confocal microscopy demonstrated subepithelial highly reflective crystals in 4 cases; the shapes of the crystals were needle-shaped (3 cases) or rectangular (1 case). A phenotype and genotype correlation was demonstrated in 1 pedigree, and phenotypic heterogeneity (SCCD with or without crystals caused by a same mutation of Y174C in the UBIAD1 gene) also was demonstrated in 1 pedigree.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nonsynonymous novel mutations in the UBIAD1 gene were detected in 3 unrelated Japanese pedigrees with SCCD, confirming the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. In vivo laser confocal microscopy is capable of identifying characteristic corneal microstructural changes related to genetically mapped SCCD with high resolution, and phenotypic heterogeneity was presented.

Cases of dominant inheritance and phenotype-genotype heterogeneity have been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not currently understood. The FMF protein named pyrin or marenostrin (P/M) is thought to be involved in regulating innate immunity but its function remains subject to controversy. Recent studies postulate that a defect in MEFV expression regulation may play a role in FMF physiopathology. Our group, along with others, has identified several alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts in leukocytes. Since alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathways are usually coupled in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that NMD could contribute to the regulation of the MEFV gene. To address this issue, we examined the effect of indirect and direct inhibition of NMD on expression of the MEFV transcripts in THP1, monocyte and neutrophil cells. We showed that MEFV is the first auto-inflammatory gene regulated by NMD in both a cell- and transcript-specific manner. These results and preliminary western-blot analyses suggest the possible translation of alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts into several P/M variants according to cell type and inflammatory state.

Recently it was shown that the vast majority of patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II carry mutations in the SEC23B gene. Here we established the molecular basis of 42 cases of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II and attempted to define a genotype-phenotype relationship.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: SEC23B gene sequencing analysis was performed to assess the diversity and incidence of each mutation in 42 patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (25 described exclusively in this work), from the Italian and the French Registries, and the relationship of these mutations with the clinical presentation. To this purpose, we divided the patients into two groups: (i) patients with two missense mutations and (ii) patients with one nonsense and one missense mutation.\nRESULTS: We found 22 mutations of uneven frequency, including seven novel mutations. Compound heterozygosity for a missense and a nonsense mutation tended to produce a more severe clinical presentation, a lower reticulocyte count, a higher serum ferritin level, and, in some cases, more pronounced transfusion needs, than homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two nonsense mutations was never found.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to determine the most frequent mutations in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II. Correlations between the mutations and various biological parameters suggested that the association of one missense mutation and one nonsense mutation was significantly more deleterious that the association of two missense mutations.

Eye morphogenesis in humans involves a molecular genetic cascade in which a number of developmental genes interact in a highly organized process during the embryonic period to produce functional ocular structures. Among these genes, paired box gene 6 (PAX6) has an essential role as it encodes a phylogenetically conserved transcription factor almost universally employed for eye formation in animals with bilateral symmetry, despite widely different embryological origins. To direct eye development, PAX6 regulates the tissue-specific expression of diverse molecules, hormones, and structural proteins. In humans, PAX6 is located in chromosome 11p13, and its mutations lead to a variety of hereditary ocular malformations of the anterior and posterior segment, among which aniridia and most probably foveal hypoplasia are the major signs. Aniridia occurs due to decreased dosage of the PAX6 gene and exists in both sporadic and familial forms.

Indeed, the degree of refinement scales with defects in the \"Down syndrome critical region\" (DSCR) in a dose-dependent manner. We further identify Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule), a gene within the DSCR, as a regulator of eye-specific segregation of retinogeniculate projections. Although Dscam is not the sole gene in the DSCR contributing to enhanced refinement in trisomy, Dscam dosage clearly regulates cell spacing and dendritic fasciculation in a specific class of retinal ganglion cells.

Correct interpretation of CHD7 variants is essential for genetic counseling. This is particularly difficult for missense variants because most variants in the CHD7 gene are private and a functional assay is not yet available. We have therefore developed a novel classification system to predict the pathogenic effects of CHD7 missense variants that can be used in a diagnostic setting. Our classification system combines the results from two computational algorithms (PolyPhen-2 and Align-GVGD) and the prediction of a newly developed structural model of the chromo- and helicase domains of CHD7 with segregation and phenotypic data. The combination of different variables will lead to a more confident prediction of pathogenicity than was previously possible. We have used our system to classify 145 CHD7 missense variants. Our data show that pathogenic missense mutations are mainly present in the middle of the CHD7 gene, whereas benign variants are mainly clustered in the 5' and 3' regions. Finally, we show that CHD7 missense mutations are, in general, associated with a milder phenotype than truncating mutations.", "entities": {"Gene": ["CHD7"], "Var": ["missense variants", "heterozygous mutations"], "Reg": ["in", "caused by"], "Disease": ["CHARGE syndrome"]}}

Recently, the albino mutation has been identified as the Arg299His missense mutation in the Tyrosinase gene and the hooded (H) locus has been mapped to the ∼460-kb region in which only the Kit gene exists. Here, we surveyed 172 laboratory rat strains for the albino mutation and the hooded (h) mutation that we identified by positional cloning approach to investigate possible genetic roots and relationships of albino and hooded rats. All of 117 existing laboratory albino rats shared the same albino missense mutation, indicating they had only one single ancestor. Genetic fine mapping followed by de novo sequencing of BAC inserts covering the H locus revealed that an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) element was inserted into the first intron of the Kit gene where the hooded allele maps. A solitary long terminal repeat (LTR) was found at the same position to the ERV insertion in another allele of the H locus, which causes the so called Irish (h(i)) phenotype. The ERV and the solitary LTR insertions were completely associated with the hooded and Irish coat patterns, respectively, across all colored rat strains examined. Interestingly, all 117 albino rat strains shared the ERV insertion without any exception, which strongly suggests that the albino mutation had originally occurred in hooded rats.", "entities": {"CPA": ["albino"], "Reg": ["as"], "Var": ["Arg299His missense mutation"], "Gene": ["Tyrosinase gene"]}}

As imprinted genes have an important role in growth and development, aberrant expression of imprinted genes due to genetic or epigenetic abnormalities is involved in the pathogenesis of human disorders, or imprinting disorders. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a representative imprinting disorder characterized by macrosomia, macroglossia and abdominal wall defects, and exhibits a predisposition to tumorigenesis. The relevant imprinted chromosomal region in BWS is 11p15.5, which consists of two imprinting domains, IGF2/H19 and CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1. BWS has five known causative epigenetic and genetic alterations: loss of methylation (LOM) at KvDMR1, gain of methylation (GOM) at H19DMR, paternal uniparental disomy, CDKN1C mutations and chromosomal rearrangements.

The study was performed on a small population of female MeCP2-deficient mice using telemetric local field potential (LFP) recordings over a 24 h period. Durations of SLEs and inter-SLEs were extracted using a rule-based automated SLE detection system for both daytime and nighttime, as well as high and low power levels of the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) of the recorded LFPs. The results suggest SLE occurrences are not influenced by circadian rhythms, but had a significantly greater association with delta power. Investigating inter-SLE and SLE states by fitting duration histograms to the gamma distribution showed that SLE initiation and termination were associated with random and deterministic mechanisms, respectively. These findings when compared to reported studies on epilepsy suggest that Rett-related seizures share many similarities with absence epilepsy.", "entities": {"Disease": ["Rett syndrome"], "Reg": ["caused by"], "Var": ["mutations"], "Gene": ["MECP2"]}}

FLLD individuals usually express an impaired or non-functional LPL enzyme with low or absent triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis activity causing severe hypertriglyceridaemia. Here we report a case of FLLD in a 29-year-old man, who initially presented with eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, elevated plasma TG concentration but no other co-morbidities. Subsequent genetic testing of the patient revealed compound heterozygosity of a novel duplication (p.R44Kfs*4) leading to a premature stop codon in exon 2 and a known mutation (N291S) in exon 5 of the LPL gene. Further biochemical analysis of the patient's postheparin plasma confirmed a reduction of total lipase activity compared with his heterozygous father carrying the common N291S mutation and to a healthy control. Also the patient showed increased (1.85-fold) activity of hepatic lipase (HL), indicating a functional link between HL and LPL. In summary, we report a case of FLLD caused by compound heterozygosity of a new duplication and a common mutation in the LPL gene, resulting in residual LPL activity. With such mutations, individuals may not receive a diagnosis before classical FLLD symptoms appear later in adulthood.

Fifteen genetic subtypes of FA have been identified. Traditional complementation tests for grouping studies have been used generally in FA patients and in stepwise methods to identify the FA type, which can result in incomplete genetic information from FA patients.\nMETHODS: We diagnosed five pediatric patients with FA based on clinical manifestations, and we performed exome sequencing of peripheral blood specimens from these patients and their family members. The related sequencing data were then analyzed by bioinformatics, and the FANC gene mutations identified by exome sequencing were confirmed by PCR re-sequencing.\nRESULTS: Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of FANC genes were identified in all of the patients. The FA subtypes of the patients included FANCA, FANCM and FANCD2. Interestingly, four FA patients harbored multiple mutations in at least two FA genes, and some of these mutations have not been previously reported. These patients' clinical manifestations were vastly different from each other, as were their treatment responses to androstanazol and prednisone. This finding suggests that heterozygous mutation(s) in FA genes could also have diverse biological and/or pathophysiological effects on FA patients or FA gene carriers. Interestingly, we were not able to identify de novo mutations in the genes implicated in DNA repair pathways when the sequencing data of patients were compared with those of their parents.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Chinese FA patients and carriers might have higher and more complex mutation rates in FANC genes than have been conventionally recognized.

The exact molecular basis of this phenotypic heterogeneity by FVIII missense mutations is elusive to date. In this study, we aimed to identify the severity determinants that cause phenotypic heterogeneity of HA. We compiled and curated a data set of 766 missense mutations from the repertoire of missense mutations in FVIII. We analysed these mutations by computational programs (e.g. Swiss-PdbViewer) and different mutation analysis servers (e.g. SIFT, PROVEAN, CUPSAT, PolyPhen2, MutPred); and various sequence- and structure-based parameters were assessed for any significant distribution bias among different HA phenotypes. Our analyses suggest that 'mutations in evolutionary conserved residues', 'mutations in buried residues', mutation-induced 'steric clash' and 'surface electrostatic potential alteration' act as risk factors towards severe HA. We have developed a grading system for FVIII mutations combining the severity determinants, and the grading pattern correlates with HA phenotype.

IVD is a FAD-containing enzyme, consisting of four identical subunits. Clinical features of IVA include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, developmental delay, metabolic acidosis, and a characteristic \"sweaty foot\" odor.

In this study, we searched for IVD mutations in five Japanese patients with IVA (neonatal type, two patients; chronic intermittent type, two patients; and mild biochemical type, one patient). The diagnosis of IVA was confirmed by urinary organic acid analysis using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. All coding exons and the flanking introns in the IVD gene were amplified by PCR and were directly sequenced.

Mutations in the SPAST (previously known as SPG4) gene that encodes the microtubule-severing protein called spastin, are the most common cause of the disease. The aetiology of the disease is poorly understood, but partial loss of microtubule-severing activity resulting from inactivating mutations in one SPAST allele is the most postulated explanation. Microtubule severing is important for regulating various aspects of the microtubule array, including microtubule number, length, and mobility. In addition, higher numbers of dynamic plus-ends of microtubules, resulting from microtubule-severing events, may play a role in endosomal tubulation and fission. Even so, there is growing evidence that decreased severing of microtubules does not fully explain HSP-SPG4. The presence of two translation initiation codons in SPAST allows synthesis of two spastin isoforms: a full-length isoform called M1 and a slightly shorter isoform called M87. M87 is more abundant in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Studies on rodents suggest that M1 is only readily detected in adult spinal cord, which is where nerve degeneration mainly occurs in humans with HSP-SPG4. M1, due to its hydrophobic N-terminal domain not shared by M87, may insert into endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and together with reticulons, atlastin and REEP1, may play a role in the morphogenesis of this organelle. Some mutated spastins may act in dominant-negative fashion to lower microtubule-severing activity, but others have detrimental effects on neurons without further lowering microtubule severing. The observed adverse effects on microtubule dynamics, axonal transport, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomal trafficking are likely caused not only by diminished severing of microtubules, but also by neurotoxicity of mutant spastin proteins, chiefly M1. Some large deletions in SPAST might also affect the function of adjacent genes, further complicating the aetiology of the disease.", "entities": {"Disease": ["hereditary spastic paraplegias", "disease"], "Var": ["Mutations", "inactivating mutations", "Some mutated", "others", "mutant"], "Gene": ["SPAST", "SPG4"], "Reg": ["cause", "of"], "NegReg": ["loss", "lower", "detrimental effects", "adverse effects", "diminished"], "CPA": ["microtubule-severing activity", "neurons", "microtubule dynamics", "axonal transport", "endoplasmic reticulum", "endosomal trafficking", "severing of microtubules", "neurotoxicity"], "Protein": ["spastins", "spastin proteins", "M1"]}}

Hypoglycemia is common in CS neonates. A previously reported individual with the rare HRAS p.Gln22Lys had hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Autopsy showed a discrete pancreatic nodule. The morphologic and immunohistochemistry findings, including loss of p57(Kip2) protein, were identical to a focal lesion of congenital hyperinsulinism, however, no KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutation was identified and germline derived DNA showed no alternation of the maternal or paternal 11p15 alleles. Here we report paternal uniparental disomy (pUPD) within the lesion, similar to the pUPD11p15.5 in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). The similar extent of the pUPD suggests a similar mechanism driving hyperinsulinemia in both conditions. After coincidental somatic LOH and pUPD, the growth promoting effects of the paternally derived HRAS mutation, in combination with the increased function of the adjacent paternally expressed IGF2, may together result in clonal expansion. Although this somatic LOH within pancreatic tissue resulted in hyperinsulinism, similar LOH in mesenchymal cells may drive embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). Interestingly, biallelic IGF2 expression has been linked to rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis and pUPD11 occurred in all 8 ERMS samples from CS individuals. Somatic KRAS and HRAS mutations occur with comparable frequency in isolated malignancies. Yet, the malignancy risk in CS is notably higher than in Noonan syndrome with a KRAS mutation.

The objective of this work was to elucidate the association between PGRN deficiency, WNT5A signalling and cell proliferation in immortalized lymphoblasts from carriers of the c.709-1G > A GRN mutation (asymptomatic and FTLD-TDP).\nMETHODS: We assessed cell proliferation in carriers of the c.709-1G > A GRN gene mutation and controls without GRN mutation and without sign of neurologic degeneration by cell counting or using an MTT assay. We used a luciferase assay to measure the nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) activity.

Therefore, we retrospectively analysed MEFV gene mutations in 383 patients with suspected FMF and the clinical features of 327 among them. The MEFV gene mutations were investigated using the reverse dot-blot hybridization technique. We detected 26 different genotypes and 11 different mutations. The most common mutations in our cohort were p.M694V (41.15%), p.E148Q (20.35%), p.M680I(G/C) (12.39%) and p.R761H (9.73%).

We interrogated the unexplained transient absence of perinatal polycythemia observed in PFCP patients using an animal model of PFCP to examine its erythropoiesis during embryonic, perinatal, and early postnatal periods. In this model, we replaced the murine EpoR gene (mEpoR) with the wild-type human EPOR (wtHEPOR) or mutant human EPOR gene (mtHEPOR) and previously reported that the gain-of-function mtHEPOR mice become polycythemic at 3~6 weeks of age, but not at birth, similar to the phenotype of PFCP patients. In contrast, wtHEPOR mice had sustained anemia. We report that the mtHEPOR fetuses are polycythemic, but their polycythemia is abrogated in the perinatal period and reappears again at 3 weeks after birth. mtHEPOR fetuses have a delayed switch from primitive to definitive erythropoiesis, augmented erythropoietin signaling, and prolonged Stat5 phosphorylation while the wtHEPOR fetuses are anemic. Our study demonstrates the in vivo effect of excessive EPO/EPOR signaling on developmental erythropoiesis switch and describes that fetal polycythemia in this PFCP model is followed by transient correction of polycythemia in perinatal life associated with low Epo levels and increased exposure of erythrocytes' phosphatidylserine.

The 786-O, A498, and RCC4 cell lines were used to investigate the mechanisms of PD-L1 regulation.\nOUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Fisher's exact test was used for VHL mutation and Kruskal-Wallis test for PD-L1 expression.

To explore the physiological significance of this processing, we isolated two Oryza sativa (rice) mutants (fuct-1 and fuct-2) with loss of FucT function. Biochemical analyses of the N-glycan structure confirmed that α1,3-fucose is missing from the N-glycans of allelic fuct-1 and fuct-2. Compared with the wild-type cv Kitaake, fuct-1 displayed a larger tiller angle, shorter internode and panicle lengths, and decreased grain filling as well as an increase in chalky grains with abnormal shape. The mutant allele fuct-2 gave rise to similar developmental abnormalities, although they were milder than those of fuct-1. Restoration of a normal tiller angle in fuct-1 by complementation demonstrated that the phenotype is caused by the loss of FucT function. Both fuct-1 and fuct-2 plants exhibited reduced gravitropic responses. Expression of the genes involved in tiller and leaf angle control was also affected in the mutants.

However, little is known about how to establish clinically relevant drug-resistant cell lines. Our study examined the impact of a drug-free period on the establishment of a cell line with clinically relevant resistance to molecular-targeted drugs. We used PC9 cells, a lung cancer cell line carrying EGFR mutation, because this is a validated target for EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). PC9 cells were intermittently or continuously exposed to increasing concentrations of gefitinib (0.01 μM to 1.0 μM) and the emergence of the most common acquired resistance mutation in EGFR, T790M, was determined. T790M was detected at a 25-fold lower drug concentration in cells continuously exposed to gefitinib (PC9/GRc) than in cells intermittently exposed to gefitinib (PC9/GRi) (0.04 μM vs 1.0 μM, respectively). The mutation frequencies at those drug concentrations were 19.8% and 8.0% in PC9/GRc and PC9/GRi cells, respectively. After drug-free culture for 8 weeks, resistance to gefitinib decreased in the PC9/GRi cells but not in the PC9/GRc cells. In the PC9/GRc cells, the frequency of the T790M mutation was consistently about 20% from 0.04 μM to 1.0 μM of gefitinib. In the PC9/GRc cells, the T790M mutation was detected in all single-cell clones, at frequencies ranging from 7.0% to 37.0%, with a median of 19.5% (95% confidence interval, 17.3%-20.9%).

Non-inversion mutations of the F8 and F9 gene were identified by targeted high-throughput sequencing. All mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS: Intron 22 inversion was detected in eight HA families and intron one inversion was detected in one HA family.

An ophthalmic examination consisting of a fundus evaluation and electroretinography (ERG) was completed, and small aliquots of blood were collected from all participating individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells, and a genome-wide linkage or a locus-specific exclusion analysis was completed with polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs).

Although several genetic mutations have been linked to HPE, phenotypic outcomes range dramatically, and most cases cannot be attributed to a specific cause. Gene-environment interaction has been invoked as a premise to explain the etiological complexity of HPE, but identification of interacting factors has been extremely limited. Here, we demonstrate that mutations in Gli2, which encodes a Hedgehog pathway transcription factor, can cause or predispose to HPE depending upon gene dosage. On the C57BL/6J background, homozygous GLI2 loss of function results in the characteristic brain and facial features seen in severe human HPE, including midfacial hypoplasia, hypotelorism and medial forebrain deficiency with loss of ventral neurospecification. Although normally indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, we demonstrate that mice with single-allele Gli2 mutations exhibit increased penetrance and severity of HPE in response to low-dose teratogen exposure. This genetic predisposition is associated with a Gli2 dosage-dependent attenuation of Hedgehog ligand responsiveness at the cellular level. In addition to revealing a causative role for GLI2 in HPE genesis, these studies demonstrate a mechanism by which normally silent genetic and environmental factors can interact to produce severe outcomes.

Here we for the first time identified Ssq1 as an essential component for iron-sulfur cluster assembly in Candida albicans. Ssq1 played an important role in cell growth. Shutting off SSQ1 led to accumulation of intracellular iron, especially in mitochondria, and disorder of intracellular iron regulation. In tetO-SSQ1, iron overloading triggered the oxidative damage of mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, disruption of SSQ1 activated autophagic pathway. The mitochondrial dysfunction was further aggravated when CCZ1 (which is essential for autophagy) and SSQ1 was simultaneously deleted, suggesting that autophagy played a critical role in maintenance of mitochondrial function in tetO-SSQ1. In addition, double deletion of SSQ1 and CCZ1 further elevated cellular iron levels in comparison with tetO-SSQ1, indicating that autophagy participated in maintenance of iron homeostasis. Furthermore, we found that loss of SSQ1 led to increasing protein expression of Rnr1 and redistribution of Rnr2 from the nucleus to cytoplasm, and further resulted in cell cycle arrest. The results implied that cell cycle arrest was caused by activating the checkpoint pathway because of impairing the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in tetO-SSQ1.

The baseline echocardiography revealed prominent dilation and trabeculations of the left ventricle with impaired systolic function in the six patients, four of which fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of left ventricular noncompaction. Other aspects of their clinical presentations included hypotonia (6/6), growth delay (6/6), neutropenia (3/6) and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (4/5). Five patients died at a median age of 7.5 months (range, 7.0-12.0 months). The cause of death was heart failure associated with infection in three patients and cardiac arrhythmia in two patients. The remaining one patient survived beyond infancy but had fallen into a persistent vegetative state after suffering from cardiac arrest.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of systematic mutation screening of TAZ in a large cohort of pediatric patients with primary cardiomyopathy using the NGS approach. TAZ mutations were found in 4/114 (3.5%) male patients with primary cardiomyopathy. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of TAZ gene testing in cardiomyopathy genetic testing panels may contribute to the early diagnosis of BTHS.", "entities": {"Gene": ["TAZ"], "Var": ["mutations"], "Reg": ["with"], "Disease": ["cardiomyopathy"]}}

We demonstrate that DONSON is a replisome component that stabilizes forks during genome replication. Loss of DONSON leads to severe replication-associated DNA damage arising from nucleolytic cleavage of stalled replication forks.

Hypomorphic mutations in DONSON substantially reduce DONSON protein levels and impair fork stability in cells from patients, consistent with defective DNA replication underlying the disease phenotype.

Our objective was to report the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of 18 CMT1C patients and compare them to 20 patients with PMP22 mutations: 10 CMT1A patients and 10 patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).\nMETHODS: Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1C patients were followed-up in referral centres for neuromuscular diseases or were identified by familial survey. All CMT1A and HNPP patients were recruited at the referral centre for neuromuscular diseases of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.\nRESULTS: Two phenotypes were identified amongst 18 CMT1C patients: the classical CMT form ('CMT-like', 11 cases) and a predominantly sensory form ('sensory form', seven cases). The mean CMT neuropathy score was 4.45 in CMT1C patients. Motor nerve conduction velocities in the upper limbs were significantly more reduced in CMT1A than in CMT1C patients. On the other hand, the motor nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was significantly lower in CMT1C compared to the HNPP group. Distal motor latency was significantly more prolonged in CMT1A patients compared to the CMT1C and HNPP groups, the latter two groups having similar distal motor latency values. Molecular analysis revealed five new LITAF/SIMPLE mutations (Ala111Thr, Gly112Ala, Trp116Arg, Pro135Leu, Arg160Cys).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study delineates CMT1C as mostly a mild form of neuropathy, and gives clinical and electrophysiological clues differentiating CMT1C from CMT1A and HNPP.

Pancreatic ATP-sensitive K (KATP) channels are key regulators of insulin secretion and comprise Kir6.2 subunits coupled to sulfonylurea receptors. Because these channels are reversibly inhibited by cytoplasmic ATP, they link cellular metabolism with membrane excitability. Loss-of-function mutations in the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit cause congenital hyperinsulinism as a result of diminished channel activity. Here, we show that several disease mutations, which disrupt intersubunit salt bridges at the interface of the cytoplasmic domains (CD-I) of adjacent subunits, induce loss of channel activity via a novel channel behavior: after ATP removal, channels open but then rapidly inactivate. Re-exposure to inhibitory ATP causes recovery from this inactivation. Inactivation can be abolished by application of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, an effect that can be explained by a simple kinetic model in which PIP2 binding competes with the inactivation process. Kir2.1 channels contain homologous salt bridges, and we find that mutations that disrupt CD-I interactions in Kir2.1 also reduce channel activity and PIP2 sensitivity. Kir2.1 channels also contain an additional CD-I salt bridge that is not present in Kir6.2 channels. Introduction of this salt bridge into Kir6.2 partially rescues inactivating mutants from the phenotype. These results indicate that the stability of the intersubunit CD-I is a major determinant of the inactivation process in Kir6.2 and may control gating in other Kir channels.", "entities": {"NegReg": ["Loss-of-function", "diminished", "disrupt", "loss"], "Var": ["mutations"], "Gene": ["Kir6.2"], "Disease": ["congenital hyperinsulinism"], "MPA": ["channel activity"], "CPA": ["intersubunit salt bridges"]}}

To date, no published studies have reported on mutations in the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene in patients with chronic periodontitis, although the roles of MEFV gene mutations in FMF and FMF-associated amyloidosis (FMF-A) are well known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequencies of MEFV gene mutations and serum amyloid A (SAA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with chronic periodontitis, FMF and FMF-A.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population included 122 patients with FMF and 128 subjects who were systemically healthy. Clinical periodontal parameters, including the plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level and percentage of bleeding on probing were recorded. Blood samples were obtained from patients with FMF and systemically healthy controls, and all mutations located on exons 2 and 10 of the MEFV gene were analyzed by DNA Sanger Sequencing, which is the gold standard. SAA and high-sensitive CRP levels were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Mean gingival index, percentage of bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level, and the levels of SAA and hs-CRP were higher in the FMF-A group than those in the FMF and control groups. The two most relevant mutations in patients with FMF were heterozygous M694V (46.2%), and heterozygous R202Q (32.7%).

Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "entities": {"Var": ["mutations", "Mutations", "mutants"], "Gene": ["IFT122", "IFT43", "IFT121", "IFT139", "IFT140", "IFT144"], "NegReg": ["impair", "defects"], "Protein": ["ciliary protein"], "MPA": ["trafficking"], "Reg": ["cause"], "Disease": ["cranioectodermal dysplasia"]}}

Though the etiology is elusive, strong evidence for a genetic contribution to TS has been established. To date, various chromosomal or genetic alterations have been implicated in its pathogenesis. Recently, the deletion in the arylacetamide deacetylase gene (AADAC) was reported to be associated with TS. To investigate the association between the AADAC gene variants and TS, we conducted genetic analysis of the AADAC gene in 200 Han Chinese patients and 300 ethnicity-matched normal controls. Two variants, including a heterozygous splice-site variant, c.361 + 1G > A (rs762169706), and a missense variant, c.744A > T (p.R248S, rs186388618), were identified in two unrelated patients. The c.361 + 1G > A variant, absent in 300 ethnicity-matched controls, led to the deletion of exon 2 in AADAC mRNA, probably associated with development of TS. The c.744A > T variant, predicted to be damaging, was identified in two normal controls. The findings indicate that the AADAC gene c.361 + 1G > A variant may be a potential candidate factor for TS development, though further investigations are warranted.", "entities": {"Disease": ["Tourette syndrome", "TS"], "Var": ["c.361 + 1G > A", "deletion"], "Reg": ["led to", "associated with", "candidate factor"], "Gene": ["AADAC"]}}

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) are the most common methods for detecting dystrophin gene mutations. This study aimed to contrast the two methods and discern the genetic characterization of patients with DMD/BMD in Eastern China.\nMethods: We collected 121 probands, 64 mothers of probands, and 15 fetuses in our study. The dystrophin gene was detected by multiplex PCR primarily in 28 probands, and MLPA was used in multiplex PCR-negative cases subsequently. The dystrophin gene of the remaining 93 probands and 62 female potential carriers was tested by MLPA directly. In fetuses, multiplex PCR and MLPA were performed on 4 fetuses and 10 fetuses, respectively. In addition, sequencing was also performed in 4 probands with negative MLPA.\nResults: We found that 61.98% of the subjects had genetic mutations including deletions (50.41%) and duplications (11.57%). There were 43.75% of mothers as carriers of the mutation. In 15 fetuses, 2 out of 7 male fetuses were found to be unhealthy and 2 out of 8 female fetuses were found to be carriers. Exons 3-26 and 45-52 have the maximum frequency in mutation regions. In the frequency of exons individually, exon 47 and exon 50 were the most common in deleted regions and exons 5, 6, and 7 were found most frequently in duplicated regions.\nConclusions: MLPA has better productivity and sensitivity than multiplex PCR. Prenatal diagnosis should be applied in DMD high-risk fetuses to reduce the disease incidence.

To date, more than 80 genes have been identified that cause autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X linked RP. However, locus and allelic heterogeneity of RP has not been fully captured yet. This heterogeneity and lack of an accurate genotype phenotype correlation makes molecular dissection of the disease more difficult. The present study was designed to characterize the underlying pathogenic variants of RP in Pakistan. For this purpose, a large consanguineous family with RP phenotype showing autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was selected after a complete ophthalmological examination. Next generation sequencing was used for the identification of molecular determinant followed by Sanger-sequencing for confirmation. After sequence analysis a novel homozygous missense mutation, (c.602 C > T) in exon 4 of the RDH5 gene (MIM: 601617) was identified. This mutation resulted in substitution of phenyl alanine for serine at amino acid 201 (p.Ser201Phe) of the RDH5 gene. The same mutation was not detected in the 200 ethnically-matched control samples by Sanger sequencing. The identified mutant allele segregated in homozygous fashion in all the affected individuals of pedigree. Identification of this mutation reveals the allelic heterogeneity of RDH5 in patients with RP phenotype. The findings of this study demonstrate the clinical significance of next generation sequencing to understand the molecular basis of diseases and would help to reveal new proteins and their function in visual cycle will pave the way for early diagnosis, genetic counseling and better therapeutic inventions.", "entities": {"Var": ["mutation", "c.602 C > T", "p.Ser201Phe"], "Gene": ["RDH5"], "Reg": ["causes", "resulted in"], "Disease": ["retinitis pigmentosa"]}}
